How to DO a New Installation:

Fixing InstallStaging Directory:
-------------------------------

Obtain Sources: 
wget http://mpp:yahyouknowme@intranet.greenplum.com/release-mpp/RHEL3U4-i686/bizgres-mpp-2_0_19-0_8_1.tar.gz .

Get the Four Tar Balls.


Untar into the correct locations:
  After untar, The binaries are available in usr/local in the directory in which is it untarred.



-- Bring up InstallAnywhere with correct *.iap_xml file.
-- Change the directories to the correct Localtion
-- Click Build 


-- Important Variable Names:
    $PRODUCT_NAME$
    $USER_INSTALL_DIR$
    $MPP_REL_NAME$


Organization:
-------------

Steps Building the Path release installer.

STAGE : PROJECT
----------------
-- For Project Change the Default installation directory to
    usr/local/bizgres-mpp-2_0_20
   Note no need of '/' in the begining.


STAGE PREINSTALL:
-----------------
-- Change the Variable Name :
   Pre-Install : Set InstallAnyWhere Variable MPP_REL_NAME
   Changed from
	mpp-pgsql-Release-2_0_18-1-> mpp-pgsql-Release-2_0_19


STAGE INSTALL
-------------
  -- Change Install Speed Folder
      $USER_HOME$/InstallAnywhere/installStaging/RHEL3-i386/usr/local/bizgres-mpp-2_0_18-1-0_8_1
      $USER_HOME$/InstallAnywhere/installStaging/RHEL3-i386/usr/local/bizgres-mpp-2_0_19-0_8_1
  -- Repeat Same for MPPServ,  BizServ, MPPSDK,  BizSDK
    -- Easy way to do this is open the file and Edit.
       Note : The directory need to exist before, otherwise installer will complain
              when loading the file.
            : At least create a fake directory to proceed with, if you don't the 
              tarballs

POST INSTALL:
-------------
   --  Don't have to do Anything

Build the Installer:
   For both with VM and without VM.

Transfering to the web.
-- cd <INST_DIR>/Web_Installers/InstData/Linux/VM/
   gzip install.bin
   cp install.bin bizgres-mpp-2_0_19-0_8_1-RHEL3-1.bin.gz
   Upload to the location:
   scp user@intranet.greenplum.com:/var/www/html/release-mpp/INSTALLER/BIZGRES-MPP/



Testing After Install.

-- Uninstall on the correct platform.
-- LookUp tests
     Check bizgres_path.sh is correct
     Check all the necessary directories are installed.
-- Run a Demo.
     Refer to documentation for running a demo.
