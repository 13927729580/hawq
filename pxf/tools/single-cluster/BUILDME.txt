1. Preparation
==============

In order to build a single-cluster you'll need to add stack binaries in the
form of tarballs (no need to extract, just keep the .tar.gz):

1) hadoop
2) hbase
3) zookeeper
4) hive
5) pxf

put these in a subdirectory under tars/ which includes the name of the release

Currently, we have release-head and dev-head
Each has a script to update its components from Jenkins jobs

2. Build
========

make clean all RELEASE=<release name> ARTIFACTS=<path to PXF tarballs>
PHD_VERSION=<PHD version to use>

Note: You have to do clean
